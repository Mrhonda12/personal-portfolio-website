# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my first personal portfolio website built with **HTML** and **CSS**.

It includes:
- A simple introduction about who I am
- Basic information about my skills and interests
- A clean layout designed to be easy to read

## Files

- `index.html` – the main webpage
- `style.css` – the stylesheet that controls colors, layout, and fonts

## How to View the Website

1. Go to this repository on GitHub.
2. Click on `index.html`.
3. Click the **"Download raw file"** button or click **"View raw"** and save it.
4. Open `index.html` in your browser by double-clicking it (or right-click → "Open with" → your browser).
