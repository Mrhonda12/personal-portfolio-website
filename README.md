Personal Protfolio Websit

This is my first personal portfolio website built with HTML and CSS.

It includes:
- A simple introduction about who I am
- Basic information about my skills and interests
- A clean layout designed to be easy to read

Files
- `index.html` – the main webpage
- `style.css` – the stylesheet that controls colors, layout, and font

How to view the Wbsite
1. Go to this repository on GitHub.
2. Click on `index.html`.
3. Click the Download raw file button or click View raw and save it.
4. Open `index.html` in your browser by double-clicking it (or right-click → "Open with" → your browser).
